# digit-recognizer
This is a python Digit recognizer model using Convolutional Neural Network.
In this python code i was able to reach 99.3% accuracy on a Kaggle test using Neural network with 15 epocs and 19 layers.
It is my second computer vision assignment and my most rewarding one but the hardest to understand.
My first attempt was 88%, my second 55% the third 10% and with the fourth and fifth i was able to reach 98% and 99% after reading other notebooks and understanding how they have choose theire filters/layers.
